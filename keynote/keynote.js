// code is nothing if you don't pay attention to the people behind it

// How Your Brain is Conspiring Against You Making Good Software
// Jenna Zeigen, @zeigenvector
	// Digital Ocean, EmpireJS
	// Cognitive Science: Thesis on how brain processes puns, "What's so funny?"

// "Humans are predicably irrational" - Dan Airely

// On Being Logical
	// All P are M.
	// All S are M.
	// Therefore, all S are P.

	// A 6 J 7

// Bugs and debugging
	// Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place
	// interpret and favor info in a way that matches to our beliefs

	// even distrust evidence that goes against our prior belief
		// i don't want my code to be wrong

	// We tend to be rigid in how we approach a problem
	// we tend block problem solutions based on past experiences

	// Eureka, i solved it!
	// no idea we were going to solve problem, even 30 seconds priot to completion

	// Breaks are more important than you think

// Other's Code
	// We tend to think about problems in fixed ways
	// Stepping into their shoes, to think through with them

	// We prefer things that we have made or assembled ourselves
		// Ikea effect

// Sprint planning
	// We're bad at making predictions on how much time it'll take us to do something
	// We think that bad things are more likely to happen to other people than ourselves

// On Open Offices
	// We're actually pretty good at filtering out unwanted stimuli
		// Selective attention
			// Dichotic listening test
	// ...but we're not totally oblivious to it
		// People notice things (name, etc)
			// Cocktail party effect
	// Selective attention requires both ignoring and paying attention
		// we hold on to what we deem important

	// But what about that juicy convo next to you??
		// Multi-tasking is hard
	// Sometimes we're helpless to the processing power of our brain
	// Stroop effect
		// recognizing color isn't automatic
			// reading easier vs interpreting color

// "Software is about People" - &yet @amydearest

// On Knowing Your Worth
	// Relatively unskilled people think they are better at tasks than they actually are

	// We tent to overestimate our own skills and abilities
		// Illusiory Superiority

		// We all have a lot more to learn than we think we do

	// Skilled people tend to think tasks that are easier for them should be easy for others

	// Imposter Syndrome
		// People don't think they deserve their achievements
		// Can be humility, but also crippling

// On Assembling a Team
	// We favor members of our own in-group
		// In-group favoritism

	// We prefer the status quo
		// Status quo bias

		// Form defaults were accpeted as the better option

	// We're liable to uphold the status quo, even when it hurts other people

	// People have a tendency to attribute situations to others' character rather than to external factors
		// Group attribution error

	// XKCD suck at math cartoon
	// https://xkcd.com/385/

	// We rely on examples that come to mind when evaluating something
		// Availability heuristic

	// We assume things in a group will resemble the prototype in favor of focusing on details
		// Someone that sounded like an engineer must be an engineer lol

		// Presentativeness Heuristic

// On Getting Past This
	// Two Thinking systems
		// Thinking fast and slow
			// System 1 - Fast
			// Systeme 2 - slow

			// We have time to think through all the things, using system 2
