## About

This site is designed as teaching aid for my "Mastering Chrome DevTools" workshops but I hope it will stand fine on its own.

The workshop is divided into multiple sections:

+ **Editing** - Changing styles and markup and persisting those changes to disk
+ **Debugging** - Using the step-through debugger to fix a buggy program
+ **Profiling** - Audit a slow page. Run a JavaScript CPU profile and figure out what's causing slowness.
+ **Timing** - See how long each function on your sites takes and figure out which one is the longest!
+ **Page Jank** - Try to identify page jank without tooling. Then use the DevTools to fix it!
+ **Memory Leaks** - Learn about the common causes of JS memory leaks. Then find the one on the page and fix it!
